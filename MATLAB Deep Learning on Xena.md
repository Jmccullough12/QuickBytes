#  MATLAB Deep Learning on Xena
MATLAB has great tools for deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
These tools can make use of GPUs, which are available for use on the Xena cluster.
This Quickbytes tutorial will mimic the official Mathworks tutorial on using deep learning for JPEG Image Deblocking.
To see that tutorial, follow this [link.](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/jpeg-image-deblocking-using-deep-learning.html#JPEGImageDeblockingUsingDeepLearningExample-2 "MathWorks Deep Learning Tutorial")

## Run Interactively
It is possible to train the the example CNN in an interactive MATLAB session and track the progress.
This requires X11 fowarding.
For a full guide on how to do that, please view our [Quickbytes youtube tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5ic9JWHuqI&t=224s&ab_channel=UNMCARC "Quickbytes X11 Forwarding Tutorial")  

Once logged into Xena with X11 fowarding, you can begin an interactive job on a compute node.
```bash

```
